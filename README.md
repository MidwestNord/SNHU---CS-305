# SNHU---CS-305
Collection of various projects and code bases that I worked on from assignments at SNHU 
- CS 305 Project One:
  Scenario: I work s a developer for a software engineering company, Global Rain, that specializes in custom software design and development. Global Rain is working with a client named Atremis Financial which is a consulting company who developes individualized financial plans for its customers.
  Artemis is looking to update their operations and utilize modern software security and seeking Global Rains help. The objective was to examine the web-based software application and identify security vulnerabilities.
  - The first objective was to manually review the code base for issues. Manual review provided obersvation that there were no test values, no test cases, no entry criteria, no exite criteria, and the Spring Maven plugin needed to be updated. It is important to code securely as to not run into the
  same issue that I did here with this application. with the implementation of these missing pieces, the code could be executed securely and provide peace of mine to thos who run and utilize the application.
  - The biggest thing I did to increase security was as simple as updating the plugins. Outdated plugins can be a security risk and have many vulnerabilities. Otherwise, the utilization of input validation, ensuring code quality, APIs, fixing code error, and cryptography were the keys to increasing
  layers of security.
  - To ensure that the code was functional and secure, static tests were run to reveal vulnerabilities as well as suggest the proper actions to take to address these issues.
